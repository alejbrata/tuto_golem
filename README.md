**The Neural Forge** is an interactive, browser-based tutorial that teaches the fundamental concepts of Generative AI (Tokens, Embeddings, Vector Search, Agents, etc.) through a fantasy narrative.

You play as an **Alchemist of Souls**, breathing life into a Golem by writing real Python code that runs directly in your browser.

## 🤖 Built with Antigravity (SDD)
This entire project was built using **Antigravity**, an advanced AI coding agent, following an **SDD (Spec/Design Driven Development)** methodology.

-   **Human Role**: Architecture, High-Level Design, UX feedback, and Code Review.
-   **AI Role**: Implementation, Debugging, Content Generation (Lore/Code), and Refactoring.

This repository serves as a showcase of what **Human-AI collaboration** can achieve: a complex, full-stack educational application built in a fraction of the time, with robust code and creative storytelling.

## 🔮 Features
-   **100% Client-Side**: Python runs in the browser via [Pyodide](https://pyodide.org/) (WebAssembly). No backend required.
-   **Gamified Curriculum**:
    -   **Book 1**: Words to Numbers (Tokenization, Embeddings, Vector DBs).
    -   **Book 2**: The Senses (Vision, Audio).
    -   **Book 3**: Reasoning (RAG, Chains).
    -   **Book 4**: Autonomy (Agents, Tools, Loops).
-   **Interactive Code Editor**: Write Python to solve "spells" (coding challenges).
-   **Visual Progression**: Watch your Golem evolve from a pile of rocks to a sentient being.
-   **Multilingual**: Available in English and Spanish.
