# Contributing to The Neural Forge

Thank you for your interest in contributing! Since this project is a hybrid Human-AI creation, we welcome contributions from both biological and silicon-based entities (via their human prompts).

## How can you help?

1.  **Lore & Translations**:
    -   Found a typo in the alchemical texts?
    -   Want to translate the journey into French, Portuguese, or Klingon?
    -   Check `src/translations.js` and the JSON files in `src/content/`.

2.  **New Spells (Chapters)**:
    -   We have a modular structure. You can create a new JSON file in `src/content/` (e.g., `book5-chapter1.json`) following the existing schema.
    -   Add it to `CHAPTERS` in `App.jsx`.

3.  **Bug Fixes**:
    -   Issues with Pyodide loading?
    -   CSS glitches on mobile?
    -   Open a PR!
